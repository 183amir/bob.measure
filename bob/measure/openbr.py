  """Writes the OpenBR matrix and mask files (version 2), given the score file.
  If gallery and probe names are provided, the matrices in both files will be sorted by gallery and probe names.
  Otherwise, the order will be the same as given in the score file.

  If ``search`` is given (as an integer), the resulting matrix files will be in the *search* format, keeping the given number of gallery scores with the highest values for each probe.

  .. warning::
    When provided with a 4-column score file, this function will work only, if there is only a single model id for each client.

  Keyword parameters:

  score_file : str
    The 4 or 5 column style score file written by bob.

  matrix_file : str
    The OpenBR matrix file that should be written.
    Usually, the file name extension is ``.mtx``

  mask_file : str
    The OpenBR mask file that should be written.
    The mask file defines, which values are positives, negatives or to be ignored.
    Usually, the file name extension is ``.mask``

  model_names : [str] or ``None``
    If given, the matrix will be written in the same order as the given model names.
    The model names must be identical with the second column in the 5-column ``score_file``.

    .. note::
       If the score file is in four column format, the model_names must be the client ids stored in the first column.
       In this case, there might be only a single model per client

    Only the scores of the given models will be considered.

  probe_names : [str] or ``None``
    If given, the matrix will be written in the same order as the given probe names (the ``path`` of the probe).
    The probe names are identical to the third column of the 4-column (or the fourth column of the 5-column) ``score_file``.
    Only the scores of the given probe names will be considered in this case.

  score_file_format : one of ``('4column', '5column')``
    The format, in which the ``score_file`` is.

  gallery_file_name : str
    The name of the gallery file that will be written in the header of the OpenBR files.

  probe_file_name : str
    The name of the probe file that will be written in the header of the OpenBR files.

  search : int or ``None``
    If given, the scores will be sorted per probe, keeping the specified number of highest scores.
    If the given number is higher than the models, ``NaN`` values will be added, and the mask will contain ``0x00`` values.
